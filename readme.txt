Bibs Twitter Follow Button Reloaded adds the official Twitter Follow Button with a Widget to your WordPress Blog to increase your readers engagement and create a connection with your Blog Readers. You can use as many widgets you want, all with different settings.

Or as an alternative you can Shortcodes like [tfb username='yourusername' count='true' lang='en' theme='light'] for light blue color or [tfb username='yourusername' count='true' lang='en' theme='dark'] for dark color. You can even mix widgets an Shortcodes.

The Widget offers more options than the Shortcode. You can use padding for better placement inside the widget.
